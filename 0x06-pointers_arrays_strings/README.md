C - More pointers, arrays and strings
Further learning on pointers, array and string through more tasks. We will be building some functions similar to some built in functions.

0. strcat
strcat a function that concatenates two strings

This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
1. strncat
strncat a function that concatenates two strings

The strncat function is similar to the strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
2. strncpy
strncpy a function that copies a string. Function works exactly like strncpy

3. strcmp
strcmp a function that compares two strings. Function works exactly like strcmp

4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
Reverse array a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

5. Always look up
String to uppercase a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes
Capitalise string a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }
7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody
Leet encoding a function that encodes a string into 1337

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
8. rot13
Rot13 encoding a function that encodes a string using rot13

9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
Print number a function that prints an integer

10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work
Magic- add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line

11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art
Infinite addition a function that adds two numbers

12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls
Print Buffer a function that prints a buffer
